spammail
========

This project contains a small shell script which sends the mail to a recipient

I have written a small shell script which will spam a mail id.
I have used a incremental variable in Subject line since google clubs mails if subject line is same

Background:
Inspired from a quora answer I decided to write this script.

I had ordered a T-Shirt from paytm.com, next day delivery marked item for return because of size issue.
I marked item for return, no mail, no calls, no sign of anything.
I complained on the paytm site for many times after struggling for a week a guy from zovi came and took the product.
He said I will get refund soon. I waited for 15 more days, no sign of mail/refund.
So I have to complain like previously I did, and struggle to get my money back instead I decided to write a script 
which will spam paytm's mail box.
I wrote a simple script and run it. Guess what? Within an hour I got refund back |..|
