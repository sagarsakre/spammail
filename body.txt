Hi,

I have requested to return an item 25th Sept 2014. After sending so many mails a zovi representative took the T-Shirt back on 30th Sept 2014, and informed that I will get a mail regarding the same soon. Its been around 20 days I requested for item return and I haven't got even a single call/mail regarding this.
		Now that I neither have the item with me nor the money is refunded. Is this the "Seal of Trust" paytm maintains? In the policy its clearly mentioned that "We will gladly accept returns for any reason within 15 days of receipt of delivery". I marked for return on the first day itself and its been 20 days no sign of money/item. 

Please find the datails below:

ORDER NO. 599995945
Zovi Blue Solid V Neck T-Shirt (Size-L)

This item has been marked for return. Our executive will reach out to you to understand & resolve the issue. And if needed, will arrange for the item to be returned.

Sagar Sakre
